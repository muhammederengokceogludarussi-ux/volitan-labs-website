## From TUSAŞ to Flutter

My engineering journey started on the factory floor at TUSAŞ, working on F-35 production lines and the GÖKBEY Helicopter prototype. That experience taught me something invaluable: **complex systems are built from simple, well-understood components.**

When I started building mobile apps with Flutter, I noticed the same principle applies. A well-architected app is just a system of components — each with a clear responsibility, well-defined interfaces, and predictable behavior.

## The Engineering Mindset

At METU, studying mechanical engineering means learning to think in systems. Every course — from thermodynamics to manufacturing processes — reinforces the same idea: understand the fundamentals, design with constraints in mind, and test rigorously.

This translates directly to software development:

- **Constraint-driven design**: In mechanical engineering, you design within material limits. In software, you design within performance budgets and user expectations.
- **Systematic debugging**: When a Siemens NX model doesn't behave as expected, you trace the problem methodically. The same approach works for debugging Flutter widgets.
- **Documentation matters**: In aerospace, every decision is documented. I bring the same rigor to my codebase.

## XFLR5 to State Management

One of my favorite parallels: aerodynamic analysis in XFLR5 is fundamentally about managing state. You define initial conditions, run simulations, and observe how the system evolves. Flutter's state management works the same way — you define initial state, handle events, and rebuild the UI accordingly.

## The Takeaway

Engineering thinking isn't about applying formulas — it's about approaching problems with structure, rigor, and humility. Whether I'm designing a UAV airframe or a mobile app, the process is surprisingly similar: understand the problem, explore solutions, build a prototype, test, iterate.

That's what makes the transition between disciplines feel natural. The tools change, but the thinking doesn't.
