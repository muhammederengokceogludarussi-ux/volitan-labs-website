## Why Focus Space?

As an engineering student juggling courses, projects, and personal development, I needed a focus tool that actually motivated me to stay on track. Most productivity apps felt sterile — all timers and no soul.

I wanted something that made focusing feel like an achievement. That's how **Focus Space** was born: a gamified productivity app where you earn XP by focusing, build your own universe, and track your growth.

## The Tech Stack

Focus Space is built with **Flutter** and **Dart**, which gives us cross-platform support from a single codebase. Here's what's under the hood:

- **Flutter** for the UI layer — custom animations, responsive layouts
- **Provider + Riverpod** for state management
- **Hive** for local data persistence
- **Firebase** for authentication and cloud sync
- **Custom animation system** for the universe-building feature

## Challenges Along the Way

### 1. The Animation System

The universe feature required a custom particle system. Each "planet" you unlock through focus sessions needs to orbit, pulse, and interact with other elements. Flutter's `CustomPainter` and `AnimationController` made this possible, but getting the performance right on lower-end devices took several iterations.

### 2. Gamification Balance

Finding the right XP curve was harder than any engineering calculation. Too easy, and users lose motivation. Too hard, and they give up. We ended up with a logarithmic curve that rewards consistency over intensity.

### 3. Timer Accuracy

Building a reliable focus timer that works in the background, respects system battery optimization, and accurately tracks time is surprisingly complex. Android's Doze mode alone required three different approaches before we found a reliable solution.

## What I Learned

Building Focus Space taught me that **engineering discipline and creative software development aren't opposites** — they're complementary. The same systematic thinking that helps me analyze stress distributions in Siemens NX helps me architect a clean, maintainable codebase.

The app is still in development, but every focus session I use to build it is, ironically, another data point proving the concept works.
