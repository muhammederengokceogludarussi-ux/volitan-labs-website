## The Student Developer's Secret Weapon

As a mechanical engineering student who also builds mobile apps, time is my scarcest resource. Between METU coursework, engineering projects, and developing Focus Space, I needed a way to move faster without cutting corners.

That's where AI-augmented development comes in.

## My Workflow

I don't use AI to replace thinking — I use it to **amplify** my engineering mindset. Here's how:

### 1. Architecture First, AI Second

Before touching any AI tool, I sketch out the architecture. What are the components? How do they interact? What are the constraints? This is pure engineering thinking — the same approach I'd use for a mechanical system design.

### 2. Claude as a Thinking Partner

I use Claude not as a code generator, but as a **thinking partner**. When I'm designing a new feature for Focus Space, I'll describe the problem, discuss trade-offs, and iterate on the approach before writing a single line of code.

### 3. Code Review and Refactoring

After implementing a feature, I use AI to review the code from different angles — performance, accessibility, edge cases. It's like having a senior developer available 24/7, which is invaluable for a student working solo.

### 4. Documentation

Writing documentation is where AI saves the most time. I can focus on the "what" and "why," and AI helps structure it into clear, comprehensive docs.

## The Engineering Parallel

In aerospace manufacturing at TUSAŞ, we had checklists, quality gates, and systematic reviews. AI-augmented development is similar — it's a quality layer that catches what you might miss.

The key is treating AI as a tool in your engineering toolkit, not as a replacement for understanding. Just like how Siemens NX doesn't replace understanding of stress analysis — it amplifies your ability to perform it.

## Results

Since adopting this workflow:

- **Faster iteration cycles** — features that took a week now take 2-3 days
- **Better code quality** — fewer bugs in production
- **More time for engineering** — I can balance both disciplines
- **Better documentation** — my codebase is actually documented

## The Future

AI-augmented development isn't about writing code faster — it's about thinking better. For a student developer balancing multiple disciplines, it's the difference between burning out and thriving.
